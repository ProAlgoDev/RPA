Questions? Suggestions? - Meet us in the UI.Vision [RPA user forum](https://forum.ui.vision).

Every user benefits from the questions and answers provided in the forum, that is why we would ask you to post the question [in the RPA forum](https://forum.ui.vision) first if a public forum is appropriate for your question. The forum is monitored by active users, tech support and the developers, so we would like to concentrate the discussion "over there" in one place


# Are you interested in becoming a UI.Vision RPA beta tester?

As beta tester, we will email you (hidden) install links for new  UI.Vision RPA versions before they go live in the Chrome store. **Beta versions never overwrite a regular  UI.Vision RPA version**. The beta channel is technically a separate extension with its own toolbar icon. So beta-testing  UI.Vision RPA does not interfere with your regular RPA projects and macros. We will notify you by email once a new version is available so you can grab it.

- [UI.Vision RPA in the Firefox Webstore](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rpa/)

- List of supported [Selenium IDE commands](https://ui.vision/rpa/docs/selenium-ide/)


# Building the Chrome and Firefox Extension

We use Node V8.11.1 and NPM V5.6.0.

You can [install UI.Vision RPA directly from the Chrome or Firefox stores](https://ui.vision/rpa), which is the easiest and the recommended way of using the UI.Vision RPA software. But of course developers can also build it directly from the source code with this command line:

```
npm i
npm run build (or build-ff for Firefox)
```

Once done, the ready-to-use extension code appears in the /dist directory (Chrome) or /dist_ff directory (Firefox).

# Need the very latest source code version?

Please note that we use an internal source code repository for our daily development work. The very latest source code snapshot can always be requested directly from the development team. Please contact us at team AT ui.vision. We are looking forward talking to you. And of course, if you want to join the development you are welcome.
