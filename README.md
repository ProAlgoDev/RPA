# Are you interested in becoming a Kantu beta tester?

As beta tester, we will email you (hidden) install links for new Kantu versions before they go live in the Chrome store. **Beta versions never overwrite a regular Kantu version**. The beta channel is technically a separate extension with its own toolbar button. We will email you once a new version is available so you can grab it. So beta-testing Kantu does not interfere with your regular Kantu projects and macros.

# Building the Chrome Extension

You can [install Kantu directly from the Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kantu-browser-automation/gcbalfbdmfieckjlnblleoemohcganoc), which is the easiest and the recommended way of using the Kantu Selenium IDE. But of course developers can also build it directly from the source code with this command line:

```
npm i
npm run build
```

Once done, the ready-to-use extension code appears in the /dist directory
